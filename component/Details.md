## What does this library do?

It allows iOS 4S+ devices with iOS 7 to use Estimote beacons. Estimote Beacons are small, wireless sensors from http://estimote.com that use a new Bluetooth low energy (BLE) chip and continually transmit radio signals that your phone can pick up.
You can think about the beacon as a small lighthouse tower that's installed in a fixed location and broadcasts its presence to all the ships (smartphones) around.
The nearby smartphones can communicate with them using an API theyâ€™ve developed. This makes it easy for developers to add micro-location features to their mobile apps.
