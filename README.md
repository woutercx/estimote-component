# Xamarin iOS Estimote component

To build this component:

* You need to have installed Xamarin in your Mac, you can download it from [here](http://xamarin.com/download)

* There's a Rakefile in this repo that will build the component for you if you
simply type `rake` in terminal inside root folder.

* Also there is a rake task named `prepare` that will download and build the binding project so you can open sample on Xamarin Studio and test it without any changes.
